   \verbatim
    GEQR computes a QR factorization of M-by-N matrix A:

    A = Q * ( R),
            ( 0)

    where:
    Q is a M-by-M orthogonal matrix;
    R is an upper-triangular N-by-N matrix;
    0 is a (M-N)-by-N zero matrix, if M > N.
   \endverbatim

* @param[in] M
         M is INTEGER \n
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0. \n
 * @param[in] N
         N is INTEGER \n
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0. \n
 * @param[in,out] A
         A is array, dimension (LDA,N) \n
         On entry, the M-by-N matrix A. \n
         On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal of the array
         contain the min(M,N)-by-N upper trapezoidal matrix R
         (R is upper triangular if M >= N);
         the elements below the diagonal are used to store part of the
         data structure to represent Q. \n
* @param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER \n
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= fla_max(1,M). \n
* @param[out] T

         On exit, if INFO = 0, T(1) returns optimal (or either minimal
         or optimal, if query is assumed) TSIZE. See TSIZE for details.
         Remaining T contains part of the data structure used to represent Q.
         If one wants to apply or construct Q, then one needs to keep T
         (in addition to A) and pass it to further subroutines. \n
* @param[in] TSIZE
         TSIZE is INTEGER \n
         If TSIZE >= 5, the dimension of the array T. \n
         If TSIZE = -1 or -2, then a workspace query is assumed. The routine
         only calculates the sizes of the T and WORK arrays, returns these
         values as the first entries of the T and WORK arrays, and no error
         message related to T or WORK is issued by XERBLA. \n
         If TSIZE = -1, the routine calculates optimal size of T for the
         optimum performance and returns this value in T(1). \n
         If TSIZE = -2, the routine calculates minimal size of T and
         returns this value in T(1). \n
* @param[out]	WORK
         (workspace) REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) \n
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) contains optimal (or either minimal
         or optimal, if query was assumed) LWORK.
         See LWORK for details. \n

         message related to T or WORK is issued by XERBLA. \n
         If LWORK = -1, the routine calculates optimal size of WORK for the
         optimal performance and returns this value in WORK(1). \n

    ORGTSQR_ROW generates an M-by-N real matrix Q_out with

    The input matrices Q(k)_in are stored in row and column blocks in A.
    See the documentation of SLATSQR for more details on the format of
    Q(k)_in, where each Q(k)_in is represented by block Householder
    transformations. This routine calls an auxiliary routine SLARFB_GETT,
    where the computation is performed on each individual block. The
    algorithm first sweeps NB-sized column blocks from the right to left
    starting in the bottom row block and continues to the top row block
    (hence _ROW in the routine name). This sweep is in reverse order of
    the order in which SLATSQR generates the output blocks.

    LAUNHR_COL_GETRFNP computes the modified LU factorization without
    pivoting of a complex general M-by-N matrix A. The factorization has
    the form:

        A - S = L * U,

    where:
       S is a m-by-n diagonal sign matrix with the diagonal D, so that
       D(i) = S(i,i), 1 <= i <= min(M,N). The diagonal D is constructed
       as D(i)=-SIGN(A(i,i)), where A(i,i) is the value after performing
       i-1 steps of Gaussian elimination. This means that the diagonal
       element at each step of "modified" Gaussian elimination is
       at least one in absolute value (so that division-by-zero not
       not possible during the division by the diagonal element);

       L is a M-by-N lower triangular matrix with unit diagonal elements
       (lower trapezoidal if M > N);

       and U is a M-by-N upper triangular matrix
       (upper trapezoidal if M < N).

    This routine is an auxiliary routine used in the Householder
    reconstruction routine CUNHR_COL. In CUNHR_COL, this routine is
    applied to an M-by-N matrix A with orthonormal columns, where each
    element is bounded by one in absolute value. With the choice of
    the matrix S above, one can show that the diagonal element at each
    step of Gaussian elimination is the largest (in absolute value) in
    the column on or below the diagonal, so that no pivoting is required
    for numerical stability [1].

    For more details on the Householder reconstruction algorithm,
    including the modified LU factorization, see [1].

    This is the blocked right-looking version of the algorithm,
    calling Level 3 BLAS to update the submatrix. To factorize a block,
    this routine calls the recursive routine CLAUNHR_COL_GETRFNP2.

    This is the recursive version of the LU factorization algorithm.
    Denote A - S by B. The algorithm divides the matrix B into four

    The subroutine calls itself to factor B11, solves for B21,
    solves for B12, updates B22, then calls itself to factor B22.

    For more details on the recursive LU algorithm, see [2].

    CLAUNHR_COL_GETRFNP2 is called to factorize a block by the blocked

    @details
    \b Purpose:
    \verbatim
    bbcsd() is inline function to call respective LAPACK API using templates.
    Where T can be REAL or DOUBLE PRECISION.

    X is M-by-M, its top-left block is P-by-Q, and Q must be no larger
    than P, M-P, or M-Q.
    BBCSD computes the CS decomposition of an orthogonal matrix in
    bidiagonal-block form,

       [ B11 | B12 0  0 ]
       [  0  |  0 -I  0 ]
    X = [----------------]
       [ B21 | B22 0  0 ]
       [  0  |  0  0  I ]

                                 [  C | -S  0  0 ]
                     [ U1 |    ] [  0 |  0 -I  0 ] [ V1 |    ]**T
                   = [---------] [---------------] [---------]   .
                     [    | U2 ] [  S |  C  0  0 ] [    | V2 ]
                                 [  0 |  0  0  I ]

    X is M-by-M, its top-left block is P-by-Q, and Q must be no larger
    than P, M-P, or M-Q. (If Q is not the smallest index, then X must be
    transposed and/or permuted. This can be done in constant time using
    the TRANS and SIGNS options. See SORCSD for details.)

    The bidiagonal matrices B11, B12, B21, and B22 are represented
    implicitly by angles THETA(1:Q) and PHI(1:Q-1).

    The orthogonal matrices U1, U2, V1T, and V2T are input/output.
    The input matrices are pre- or post-multiplied by the appropriate
    singular vector matrices.

     nonnegative diagonal matrices satisfying C^2 + S^2 = I, in which

     K2-by-K2 identity matrix, where K1 = MAX(Q+P-M,0), K2 = MAX(Q-P,0).

    where P(k) is a plane rotation matrix defined by the 2-by-2 rotation

       R(k) = ( c(k)  s(k))
            = (-s(k)  c(k)).

    When PIVOT = 'V' (Variable pivot), the rotation is performed
    for the plane (k,k+1), i.e., P(k) has the form

       P(k) = ( 1                                           )
              (      ...                                    )
              (             1                               )
              (                  c(k)  s(k)                 )
              (                 -s(k)  c(k)                 )
              (                               1             )
              (                                    ...      )
              (                                           1 )

    where R(k) appears as a rank-2 modification to the identity matrix in
    rows and columns k and k+1.

    When PIVOT = 'T' (Top pivot), the rotation is performed for the
    plane (1,k+1), so P(k) has the form

       P(k) = ( c(k)                    s(k)                )
              (        1                                    )
              (             ...                             )
              (                    1                        )
              (-s(k)                    c(k)                )
              (                                1            )
              (                                     ...     )
              (                                            1)

    where R(k) appears in rows and columns 1 and k+1.

    Similarly, when PIVOT = 'B' (Bottom pivot), the rotation is
    performed for the plane (k,z), giving P(k) the form

       P(k) = (1                                            )
              (     ...                                     )
              (            1                                )
              (                 c(k)                    s(k))
              (                        1                    )
              (                             ...             )
              (                                    1        )
              (                -s(k)                    c(k))

    where R(k) appears in rows and columns k and z.  The rotations are
    performed without ever forming P(k) explicitly.
